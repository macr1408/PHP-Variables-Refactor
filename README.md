## Contributing

I developed this extension with the intention of it being freely available, open source, and supported collectively. Therefore, please don't anticipate significant updates from me beyond critical bug fixes.

If you have a suggestion for a new feature, I'm open to considering it. However, it's worth noting that I'm not particularly proficient in TypeScript (as you may have noticed if you've looked at the source code). That said, I encourage anyone with the expertise to create a pull request, and if it aligns with the project's goals, I'll gladly support merging it.
